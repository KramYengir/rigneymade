            Simplifying Digital Solutions for Your Business
          </h2>

            I'm Mark, an Irish web developer living in Liverpool, with a genuine
            love for helping people. After graduating in Software Development, I
            stepped away from the office world and took a completely different
            path, managing and cooking at a popular fish & chip shop. It was
            during this time that I discovered how much I enjoy helping others
            with their digital needs.
            <br />
            <br />
            After taking on the challenge of making a website for the shop, I
            began dedicating my free time to web development, aiming to start a
            small business that could make digital services more accessible to
            those who might find them daunting. Along the way, I found myself
            also creating logos and graphics for friends and business owners â€” a
            creative process that turned out to be both enjoyable and
            fulfilling. As a result, RigneyMade expanded to include logo design,
            bringing brands to life with both form and function.
            <br />
            <br />
            At RigneyMade, I bring a commitment to approachability and
            integrity. I&apos;m here to offer down-to-earth, honest support,
            whether you&apos;re just starting out or ready to give your business
            a fresh digital presence.
